# apriltag_utils
Heavily rewritten version of apriltag_ros containing directory reorganization and inclusion of a Eigen subclass to handle SO3 / SE3 operations and easy conversion to / from ros messages

This is a ROS wrapper for publishing Apriltag with Jetson nano and RPI camera V2 through CSI  
It is truely easy to use. On jetson nano with ROS. A constant velocity EKF filter is introducted to enhance the performance.  
## Complie Instruciton
```
catkin build
```

To avoid some out of view situation , a constant velocity kalman filter has been added to the package. It now can output 100Hz pose estimation of apriltag and able to compensate some undesirable situation.
